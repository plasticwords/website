              <p>At <span class="plastic-words-about-feature">Plastic Words</span>, we create communications that resonate with your audience. We blend innovative tools with tried-and-true storytelling techniques to create unique and impactful communication assets. From website copy to social media content, we ensure your messaging is purposefully developed and effectively delivered.</p>
              
              <p>It all started when Mike Vallender decided he’d seen enough spreadsheets and business plans. He returned to university and enrolled in a creative writing degree. He met Rory and Ashleigh on campus and pitched <span class="plastic-words-about-feature">Plastic Words</span>, a place to connect skilled writers to organisations that need creative, strategic communication. We met Christian and Tim and worked on a couple of great projects, and we are now aiming to scale up our operations.</p>
