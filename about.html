            At Plastic Words, we create communications that resonate with your audience. We blend innovative tools with tried-and-true storytelling techniques to create unique and impactful communication assets. From website copy to social media content, we ensure your messaging is purposefully developed and effectively delivered.<br>
            <br>
            It all started when Mike Vallender decided he’d seen enough spreadsheets and business plans. He returned to university and enrolled in a creative writing degree. He met Rory and Ashleigh on campus and pitched Plastic Words, a place to connect skilled writers to organisations that need creative, strategic communication. We met Christian and Tim and worked on a couple of great projects, and we are now aiming to scale up our operations.
