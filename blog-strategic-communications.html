        <p>Once a company reaches a specific size, it will most likely deal with the market similarly when attracting new clients. It will advertise, generate leads, qualify prospects, and make sales, often using the same processes implemented for pure function in the early days of business.</p>

        <p>If I asked you who your favourite customer is, you would probably have a couple of clients you love doing business with. This is especially true of clients you have a long ongoing relationship with, who pay their bills on time and are always up for advocating on your behalf. How do you create these customers out of communications?</p>

        <p class="blog-subtitle">Strategic communications and the sales pipeline</p>

        <p>Getting people to respond to advertisements is hard enough, let alone attracting prospects you want to do business with.</p>

        <p class="blog-subtitle">Are you creating suitable leads?</p>
        
        <p>How are you using your <span class="blog-text-styling">website?</span> Are you sending engaging <span class="blog-text-styling">electronic direct marketing?</span> What does your <span class="blog-text-styling">social media messaging</span> look like? Communication that is purposeful and targeted to your customer base speaks directly to your ideal lead.</p>

        <p class="blog-subtitle">What is your process for contacting qualified leads?</p>

        <p>When a qualified lead is made, how do you identify and reach out to them? Is the next step an <span class="blog-text-styling">email, phone conversation,</span> or an <span class="blog-text-styling">in-person catch up?</span> Refining the way you reach out to leads puts you above the spam. A first impression will set a standard your customers expect.</p>

        <p class="blog-subtitle">How do you talk money?</p>

        <p>How do you then move the conversation from <span class="blog-text-styling">proposal</span> to <span class="blog-text-styling">quotes?</span> Having a clear cut and accurate template for taking the conversation to concrete numbers gives your client a sense of accuracy, clarity, and reliability.</p>

        <p class="blog-subtitle">What is your follow-up process</p>

        <p>When you’re in a conversation about the sale stages, how does that happen? Do you <span class="blog-text-styling">email</span> to keep everything in writing? Over the <span class="blog-text-styling">phone</span> for responsive and immediate updates? Or <span class="blog-text-styling">in person</span> meetings so everyone’s on the same level? Connective communication suited to your sales delivery keeps your customer feeling in control and up to date.</p>

        <p class="blog-subtitle">How do you close business?</p>

        <p>When business is done and signed over what does that final <span class="blog-text-styling">contract</span> look like? A standardised document that covers everything makes sure you and your customer have a checklist that covers everything.</p>

        <p class="blog-subtitle">How do you take care of your customer ongoingly?</p>

        <p>Throughout and after the sale, your customer is connecting and communicating with you. Making sure they feel looked after and informed before, during and after a sale develops an ongoing relationship that pays more for your company than just one sale.</p>

        <p>Strategic communications benefits every level of your company.</p>
